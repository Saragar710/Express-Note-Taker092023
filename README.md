# Express-Note-Taker092023

## Description
This app will help you organize you day, week or month.  You can add notes as reminders so you will never miss another appointment. With a little more time I would like to add code to set reminders and alarms to also remind you when you have an upcoming event. For this app I learned how to tie front end and backend together. It's not perfect, but I will continue to learn as we go along.


## Installation
Simply type npm start and the app with do the rest.
